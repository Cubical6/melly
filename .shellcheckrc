# ShellCheck Configuration for Melly Project
#
# This configuration enables ShellCheck to lint shell scripts in the Melly project,
# particularly focusing on validation scripts in plugins/melly-validation/scripts/

# Enable checking of external sources (sourced files, etc.)
external-sources=true

# Set source path to Melly validation scripts directory
# This allows ShellCheck to find and analyze sourced scripts
source-path=./plugins/melly-validation/scripts:./scripts

# Disable specific warnings:
# SC1090 - Ignore "ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source" (external sourcing)
# SC1091 - Ignore "Not following sourced file" (external file dependencies)
disable=SC1090,SC1091

# Set severity level to warning (catches more issues than error-only)
# Levels: error, warning, info, style
severity=warning

# Enable color output for better readability in terminal
color=always

# Additional useful settings for production scripts:

# Format output as gcc-style for IDE integration
# format=gcc
